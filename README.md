arc_db_SQL (SQL Database Project)
--------------------------------------
My group had created a DB to be used in ARC center in UW Bothell,
to handle the rentals of equipments and reservation of the rooms.
This DB can be accessed with an web application by users to make the changes,
and MySQL was used to build the SQL tables.

--------------------------------------
Final Project done by me and other teammate to handle the video rentals
at the video rental store. We were given a list of customers, movies, and commands and our project would successfully read the format of the text file and track the rentals made.

web_development_for_networkmotif (JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS)
--------------------------------------
Converted the use of the library from terminal command prompt to a web application so without having the correct setup, any users can easily access the library and query the Network Motif data without knowledge of how to run the command line.
