""" 
Blackjack Simulation - Visualize
Visualize work as the Driver for the Blackjack Simulation.

Once the program runs, it will simulate the blackjack
as if it was played by an actual player and a dealer.

All of the win, loss, tie, chipcounts will be counted for,
and is used to plot the analysis on the graphical figure.

The simulation is executed 4 times in our simulation,
and per simulation, a different variable can change to compare the
result for our analysis.
